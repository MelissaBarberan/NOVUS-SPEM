# Novus Spem, 3D printing of upper limb prosthesis and geolocation mobile application 
<p align="justify"> This paper presents the design and construction of an upper limb prothesis proto-type, 
  <a href="https://n9.cl/48g7">NOVUS SPEM</a> , created using 3D printing considering the following factors: time needed for elaboration, the use of materials that facilitate the prosthesis man-ufacturing and durability, functionality for tasks such as gripping and holding objects and the incorporation of computational components adapted for a geoloca-tion monitoring experience.  The durability of the prosthesis is considered, espe-cially accounting for high-temperature spaces, and the design includes an anti-flammable coating according to established standards. A mobile application is also developed as a complementary part of the prosthesis to improve user safety, using Arduino to identify the prothesis’s location and position at low cost.  The investigation also includes the results of the analysis of the following aspects: improved quality of life, functionality, improved physical appearance, emotional wellness and satisfaction.

# User Interface
<p align="justify">The mobile application developed in Kodular  for Android devices al-lows the user to register one person per available GPS device, through the Inter-national Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), associated with an email. For the safety of the prosthesis and the patient, the application records information and routs in real time.</p>

<p align="justify">According the results of the survey, 63% of users have experience using mobile appli-cations with geolocation features. Study participants have used the GPS of their mobile device and 37% of study participants experience its use-fulness when testing the Novus Spem application.</p>

<p align="justify">84% of the participants believe that new technologies including objects build with 3D printers contribute to improvements in people’s quality of life.   It is noted that objects built with 3D printers are not common in the environments in which study participants live.  The study presents the finished prosthesis to the partic-ipants. </p>

<p align="justify">The acquisition of a prostheses in Ecuador is not very common due to the high cost of prostheses, the technology required in the design and the elaboration process.  The results of the study show that 94% of participants would be willing to acquire a 3D prosthesis and the mobile application presented in this study </p>

<p align="justify">These values are congruent with the results obtained in the question “Would you recommend Novus Spem to institutions that collaborate with people with physical disabilities for their implementation and use” with 95% affirmative responses</p>
