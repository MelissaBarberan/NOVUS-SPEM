# Novus Spem, 3D printing of upper limb prosthesis and geolocation mobile application 
<p align="justify"> This paper presents the design and construction of an upper limb prothesis proto-type, 
  <a href="https://n9.cl/48g7">NOVUS SPEM</a> , created using 3D printing considering the following factors: time needed for elaboration, the use of materials that facilitate the prosthesis man-ufacturing and durability, functionality for tasks such as gripping and holding objects and the incorporation of computational components adapted for a geoloca-tion monitoring experience.  The durability of the prosthesis is considered, espe-cially accounting for high-temperature spaces, and the design includes an anti-flammable coating according to established standards. A mobile application is also developed as a complementary part of the prosthesis to improve user safety, using Arduino to identify the prothesis’s location and position at low cost.  The investigation also includes the results of the analysis of the following aspects: improved quality of life, functionality, improved physical appearance, emotional wellness and satisfaction.
