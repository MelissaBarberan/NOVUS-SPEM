# Novus Spem, 3D printing of upper limb prosthesis and geolocation mobile application 
<p align="justify"> This paper presents the design and construction of an upper limb prothesis proto-type, 
  <a href="https://n9.cl/48g7">NOVUS SPEM</a> , created using 3D printing considering the following factors: time needed for elaboration, the use of materials that facilitate the prosthesis man-ufacturing and durability, functionality for tasks such as gripping and holding objects and the incorporation of computational components adapted for a geoloca-tion monitoring experience.  The durability of the prosthesis is considered, espe-cially accounting for high-temperature spaces, and the design includes an anti-flammable coating according to established standards. A mobile application is also developed as a complementary part of the prosthesis to improve user safety, using Arduino to identify the prothesisâ€™s location and position at low cost.  The investigation also includes the results of the analysis of the following aspects: improved quality of life, functionality, improved physical appearance, emotional wellness and satisfaction.
